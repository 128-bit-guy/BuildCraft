Changes:

* Map locations now require shift-clicking to clear before they can be set to use a new location

Bugs Fixed:

* [#3323] Quarry: Reports its location as the currently mined block, not the actual quarry
* [#3307] Auto-workbench doesn't start crafting when items are inserted.
* [#3349] Oil can sometimes poke through the bottom of the world.
* [FORUM] Pipe items not clearing up their openGL render data. Ever.
