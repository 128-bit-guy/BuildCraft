Breaking Changes:

* Transport:
  * Actions and triggers on gates are based upon the side that they act on, rather than being generic and deciding which tile to use by themselves.
  * Gate expansions have been moved to seperate pluggables.
    * The "Autarchic gate" expansion is now the "Pipe Pulsar" pluggable, and requires a redstone engine to craft.

* Silicon:
  * Added the remaining 12 colours of pipe wire. Pipe wire is now placed manually on the 8 corners of a pipe.
  * Removed the emerald chipset and the pulsating chipset
    * All recipes using those chipsets now use a different item.

Additions:

* Lib:
  * Moved "buildcraft.core.lib" into its own module, which is contained within the "core" jar file, or can be downloaded seperatly.
  * This allows developers to use all of the BC library code, without forcing players to also have buildcraft itself.

Improvements:

* General:
  * All coloured items (pipes, paintbrushes, pipe wire) is displayed with an appropriate text colour infront.
    * This behaviour can be toggled in the config, or in game.
  * Tanks in gui's now display their contents.
  * Tanks in gui's can be added to or removed from by clicking on them with a bucket or other fluid container in hand.
    * This removes most of the slots found in various fluid holding blocks, such as the combustion engine.
  * Displayed fluid values can be displayed in buckets or millibuckets, and in long or short form
    * This behaviour can be toggled in the config, or in game.
  * You can now clone items from phantom slots if you are in creative mode
  * Gui ledgers now render their contents even if they are not fully open
  * Most gui's now have a "help" ledger, which describes whatever gui element you are hovering over.
  * Tiles save the first valid player as their owner, which is used as the fake player UUID.
    * This owner is displayed in a ledger in the gui, alongside the face of the owner.

* Builders:
  * Quarries now have a mining animation (afdw)

* Transport:
  * The wooden-diamond pipe (formally known as the emerald pipe) shows the current index of what is being extracted, when in round-robin mode.
  * Gates:
    * Added a small selection area for changing between different triggers, actions and paramaters. Complex params still require the existing mechanism (for example with itemstack params)
    * Dragging a trigger or action with the secondary mouse button will copy that statement, and can be placed in a similar way to dragging from the side selections.
