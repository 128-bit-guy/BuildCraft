Breaking Changes:

* General:
  * Volume Boxes
    * Right-click block with volume box to place in near this block
    * Right-click volume box with wrench to activate editing mode
      * Move and look to change size
      * Right-click to confirm
      * Shift+Right-click to cancel
    * Addons
      * Right-click corner of volume box with addon to install it
      * Right-click addon with wrench to open its GUI
      * Shift+Right-click addon with wrench to remove it
    * Shift+Right-click volume box with wrench to remove it

* Transport:
  * Actions and triggers on gates are based upon the side that they act on, rather than being generic and deciding which tile to use by themselves
  * Gate expansions have been moved to separate pluggables
    * The "Autarchic gate" expansion is now the "Pipe Pulsar" pluggable, and requires a redstone engine to craft

* Silicon:
  * Added the remaining 12 colours of pipe wire. Pipe wire is now placed manually on the 8 corners of a pipe (afdw)
  * Removed the emerald chipset and the pulsating chipset
    * All recipes using those chipsets now use a different item

* Robotics:
 * Zone Planner
    * 3D map (afdw)
    * Brushes slots are now not fake slots but slots for storing brushes in it (empty in new machine) (afdw)
    * By default all layers are displayed (afdw)
    * When taking colored brush from slot with mouse layer of its color will be displayed (afdw)
    * Left-click while having colored brush on your cursor to add rectangle to layer (afdw)
    * Right-click while having colored brush on your cursor to subtract rectangle to layer (afdw)

Additions:

* Lib:
  * Moved "buildcraft.core.lib" into its own module, which is contained within the "core" jar file, or can be downloaded seperatly
  * This allows developers to use all of the BC library code, without forcing players to also have buildcraft itself

Improvements:

* General:
  * All coloured items (pipes, paintbrushes, pipe wire) is displayed with an appropriate text colour infront
    * This behaviour can be toggled in the config (gui or file)
  * Tanks in gui's now display their contents
  * Tanks in gui's can be added to or removed from by clicking on them with a bucket or other fluid container in hand
    * This removes most of the slots found in various fluid holding blocks, such as the combustion engine
  * Displayed fluid values can be displayed in buckets or millibuckets, and in long or short form
    * This behaviour can be toggled in the config, or in game
  * You can now clone items from phantom slots if you are in creative mode
  * Gui ledgers now render their contents even if they are not fully open
  * Most gui's now have a "help" ledger, which describes whatever gui element you are hovering over
  * Tiles save the first valid player as their owner, which is used as the fake player UUID
    * This owner is displayed in a ledger in the gui, alongside the face of the owner

* Factory:
  * Pump, Mining Well
    * The frame will break automatically when you break quarry (afdw)
    * You can't break the frame manually (afdw)

* Builders:
  * Quarry:
    * The drill bit has an animation while it is mining (afdw)
    * The frame has a collision box (so you can walk on top of it) (afdw)
    * The frame will break automatically when you break quarry (afdw)

* Transport:
  * The wooden-diamond pipe (formally known as the emerald pipe) shows the current index of what is being extracted, when in round-robin mode.
  * The stripes pipe now shows which direction it is pointing.
  * Gates:
    * Added a small selection area for changing between different triggers, actions and parameters. Complex params still require the existing mechanism (for example with itemstack params)
    * Dragging a trigger or action with the secondary mouse button will copy that statement, and can be placed in a similar way to dragging from the side selections.
