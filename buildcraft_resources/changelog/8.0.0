Breaking Changes:

* Transport:
  * Actions and triggers on gates are based upon the side that they act on, rather than being generic and deciding which tile to use by themselves.
  * Gate expansions have been moved to seperate pluggables.

Additions:

* 

Improvements:

* General:
  * You can now clone items from phantom slots if you are in creative mode
* Transport:
  * The wooden-diamond pipe (formally known as the emerald pipe) shows the current index of what is being extracted, when in round-robin mode.
  * Gates:
    * Added a small selection area for changing between different triggers, actions and paramaters. Complex params still require the existing mechanism (for example with itemstack params)
    * Dragging a trigger or action with the secondary mouse button will copy that statement, and can be placed in a simalir way to dragging from the side selections.
