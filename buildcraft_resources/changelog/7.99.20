Additions:

* Re-added JSON-based assembly recipes, and made them load from "/config/buildcraft/assembly_recipes_pre_mj" folder. (AlexIIL)
  * Currently they will crash the game if any errors are detected in any of the json files - although it will print out every error before crashing.
  * The "pre_mj" bit is important - these assembly recipe formats will change in the future MJ update, so please don't create a lot of them or you will just have to rewrite them in the future.
  * Integration recipes haven't been readded though.

* [#4044] Vanilla flowing water blocks are invisible with BC installed (AlexIIL)
* [#4296] The marker connector recipe requires buildcraft wooden gears rather than any item that has an ore-dictionary name of "gearWood" (AlexIIL)
