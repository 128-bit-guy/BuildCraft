Breaking changes:

* The flood gate no longer uses the open sides to determine the sides to fill out in-world.

Additions:

* Re-added JSON-based assembly recipes, and made them load from "/config/buildcraft/assembly_recipes_pre_mj" folder. (AlexIIL)
  * Currently they will crash the game if any errors are detected in any of the json files - although it will print out every error before crashing.
  * The "pre_mj" bit is important - these assembly recipe formats will change in the future MJ update, so please don't create a lot of them or you will just have to rewrite them in the future.
  * Integration table recipes haven't been re-added though.
* Added a config option for tweaking the maximum depth that the mining well, quarry, and pump can extend their tubes. (AlexIIL)
  * This is called "general.miningMaxDepth" and can be changed from anywhere between 32 and 4096.
  * (Values above 256 make no difference in vanilla, this is primarily for Cubic Chunk support)

Improvements:

* [meta] BuildCraftCompat is now included in an "all" jar file (named "buildcraft-all-7.99.20.jar").
  * The previous "buildcraft-7.99.19" jar file has been renamed "buildcraft-main-7.99.20.jar"
  * As such the compat module will have the same version number as the rest of buildcraft
  * In addition it no longer has a separate changelog.

Ported content:

* [#4299] Re-added the power requested trigger (therealfarfetchd)

Bug fixes:

* Fix the quarry, pump, and mining well not digging below Y=0 when cubic chunks is installed. (AlexIIL)
* Slightly fix the quarry being slower than it should be - it's now a tiny bit faster than it used to be. (AlexIIL)
* Fixed the pump and flood gate not working correctly with gaseous fluids.
* [#4044] Vanilla flowing water blocks are invisible with BC installed (AlexIIL)
* [#4296] The marker connector recipe requires buildcraft wooden gears rather than any item that has an ore-dictionary name of "gearWood" (AlexIIL)
* [#4300] The obsidian pipe doesn't instantly pull in the entire stack of item entities that collide with it.
