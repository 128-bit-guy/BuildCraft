Ported content:

* [#4162] Re-added the quarry mining multiplier. Now this applies to everything in buildcraft that breaks a block.
  * This doesn't allow configuring for each machine individually at the moment, but it seems reasonable to add something like that if someone asks.

Additions:

* Re-added the list recipe as a crafting recipe, at least until the new assembly table API is finished.

Improvements:

* Pressing F3+T while in the guide book will reload it in-place.
* The config files are saved more often during init, which should help when you need to change a config option just to boot the game but can't because the config file is empty. 
* The github issue link shown in the open-world warning message now prefills some useful information.

Bug fixes:

* [#4133] The fluid triggers relating to percentage of a tank filled don't recognise gaseous fluids properly.
* [#4245] Random stack trace caused by a null world in a WorldTickEvent.
* [#4249] The guidebook gui lags when it is opened.
* [#4257] Oil biome generation crashes if the biome registry doesn't contain the oil biomes.
  * This is normally caused when connecting to a server that doesn't have buildcraft installed.
* Fixed gates sometimes not correctly synchronising the light on the gate when it is first turned on.
* Fixed a few recipes requiring the quarry to be present, rather than itself.
* Fixed GuiScreenBuildCraft not passing on tick()'s to child listeners. Only affects addon developers, as BC itself doesn't use this class for anything yet.
* Fixed the quarry not using the config option "quarryFrameMinHeight".
