API (code) Changes:

* IPipeRegistry.createItemForPipe now registers the returned items with forge, so that addons don't have to.
* Added IPipeRegistry.createUnnamedItemForPipe is similar to IPipeRegistry.createItemForPipe
  * With one exception: the caller must set the registry, unlocalised, and creative tabs.
  * This is accomplished by providing a Consumer<Item> in order to set the properties.

Changes:

* The christmas event is over
  * Chocolate based names have been replaced with oil based ones.
  * A config option has been added (events.christmas_chocolate) to enable or disable the event.

Bugs fixed:

* [#3891] The quarry sometimes goes into an infinite loop when calculating frame positions.
* [#3937] Disabling the facade item crashes the game.
* [#3944] The autoworkbench doesn't clear its old items properly, leading to buggy behaviour with containing items (such as buckets)
* [#3948] The autoworkbench doesn't craft fireworks properly when multiple things attempt to craft the same item.
* [#3886] The combustion engine doesn't move fluid containers around properly, either duplicating or voiding items and fluids.
