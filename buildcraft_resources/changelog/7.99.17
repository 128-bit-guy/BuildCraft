* [#4080] Re-added the config option to change the rate of oil well generation and generation of a spout.

Bug fixes:

* [#3477] Only the wooden pipe attempts to always face a valid direction.
  * (This only affects the iron pipe in buildcraft, however addon pipes that extend PipeBehaviourDirection but don't allow the centre will benefit from this).
* [#4124] The direction of an iron pipe cannot be changed by clicking the centre unless the pipe is already facing a direction.
* [#4082] Fluids can no longer be mined by Mining Well
