Improvements:

* Item pipes now send the item all the way into a block, rather than stopping when then item is half-way in.
* [#4062] The gate GUI now allows equal actions to be assigned to trigger slots, and vice versa.
  * Currently this means the following can be converted:
    * Trigger "Redstone Signal is on" <-> Action "Turn On Redstone Signal"

Ported content:

* The stripes pipe can now extend and retract pipes.

Bug fixes:

* [#4031] Tanks that disallow connections via the new canConnectTo(tank) method doesn't render properly.
* [#4067] The heat exchanger sometimes crashes when looking around for adjacent heat exchangers.
* [#4100] The filler GUI doesn't resize itself properly.
