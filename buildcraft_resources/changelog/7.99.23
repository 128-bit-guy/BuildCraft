Improvements:

* Raised the maximum power rate for the quarry from around 30 MJ/second to about 100 MJ/second.
* Changed the page number colour of guide book pages to the same as the header to make it easier to focus on the main content.
* Improved the guide book performance by collapsing highly varied items (like facades and covers) into a single page entry for searching.

Bug fixes:

* [#4359] Fixed a cache issue which caused items to disappear from transport pipes.
